- 👋 Hi, I’m @Viper702 or Viper.
- 👀 I’m interested in every aspect of anything computer related.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to create an artificially intelligent entity and run it on my local network, NVIDIA GPUs (Tesla k80 specifically), Python, Huggingface, etc.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything!
- 📫 How to reach me: It's not too hard to fugure that out.
